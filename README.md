# StockBro AI

StockBro AI is an agentic AI-driven multi-agent system inspired by **Finsage AI**. It supports retail investors, analysts, and financial enthusiasts by combining real-time market data, news sentiment, and scenario simulations, all powered by advanced LLMs and coordinated agents.

---

## üîç Overview

StockBro AI provides:

- **Real-time stock market insights & analytics**, including metrics like P/E, EPS, etc.  
- **Multi-agent architecture** using Phidata (or another orchestrator), where different agents specialize in different tasks (e.g. data fetching, sentiment analysis, model simulation).  
- **Built-in LLM agents** using Llama 3.1 (8B Instant) for intelligent reasoning, summarization, interpretation.  
- **Live news fetching & sentiment / thematic analysis** via APIs (Finnhub, NewsAPI, etc.).  
- **What-if / scenario simulation tools**: users can explore how changes in key financial variables might play out.  
- **Extensible framework**: easy to add new agents, integrate new APIs, or branch out into frontend/dashboard/model components.
